# Some info

Differs from BSA template in that we use ShadcnUI and pnpm.

Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm`.

# DEFAULT REAMDE: React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
});
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from "eslint-plugin-react";

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: "18.3" } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs["jsx-runtime"].rules,
  },
});
```

# OLD README: Sui x BSA 2024 dApp Starter Template

Welcome to the [BSA](https://bsaepfl.ch/) x [SUI](https://sui.io/) Hackathon Official Starter Pack ! This kit should provide you with tons of tools to make your hackathon experience seamless and easy, so ou can focus on what you do best !

This starter pack was made by BSA comitee member [Loris](https://github.com/Loris-EPFL), feel free to contact me for any questions, bug reports, etc...

This dApp was created using `@mysten/create-dapp` that sets up a basic React
Client dApp using the following tools:

- [React](https://react.dev/) as the UI framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for build tooling
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling classes
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) for pre-built UI components
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
- [`@mysten/dapp-kit`](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) for connecting to
  wallets and loading data
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management

IMPORTANT ! : To select your desired network for the dapp, create a .env file at the root of the project, add either VITE_NETWORK="testnet" for testnet or VITE_NETWORK="mainnet" for mainnet. Dapp default to testnet if no .env file is provided.

[guide](http://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/app-examples/e2e-counter#frontend).

## Deploying your Move code

### Install Sui cli

Before deploying your move code, ensure that you have installed the Sui CLI. You
can follow the [Sui installation instruction](https://docs.sui.io/build/install)
to get everything set up.

This template uses `testnet` by default, so we'll need to set up a testnet
environment in the CLI:

```bash
sui client new-env --alias testnet --rpc https://fullnode.testnet.sui.io:443
sui client switch --env testnet
```

If you haven't set up an address in the sui client yet, you can use the
following command to get a new address:

```bash
sui client new-address secp256k1
```

This well generate a new address and recover phrase for you. You can mark a
newly created address as you active address by running the following command
with your new address:

```bash
sui client switch --address 0xYOUR_ADDRESS...
```

We can ensure we have some Sui in our new wallet by requesting Sui from the
faucet (make sure to replace the address with your address):

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://faucet.testnet.sui.io/gas' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "FixedAmountRequest": {
        "recipient": "<YOUR_ADDRESS>"
    }
}'
```

### Publishing the move package

The move code for this template is located in the `move` directory. To publish
it, you can enter the `move` directory, and publish it with the Sui CLI:

```bash
cd move
sui client publish --gas-budget 100000000 counter
```

In the output there will be an object with a `"packageId"` property. You'll want
to save that package ID to the `src/constants.ts` file as `PACKAGE_ID`:

```ts
export const TESTNET_COUNTER_PACKAGE_ID = "<YOUR_PACKAGE_ID>";
```

Now that we have published the move code, and update the package ID, we can
start the app.

## Starting your dApp

To install dependencies you can run

```bash
pnpm install
```

To start your dApp in development mode run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To build your app for deployment you can run

```bash
pnpm build
```
